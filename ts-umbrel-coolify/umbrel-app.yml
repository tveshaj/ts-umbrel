description: >-
  Coolify is an open-source & self-hostable alternative to Heroku / Netlify / Vercel / etc.
  It helps you manage your servers, applications, and databases on your own hardware; you only need an SSH connection. You can manage VPS, Bare Metal, Raspberry PIs, and anything else.
  Imagine having the ease of a cloud but with your own servers. That is Coolify.
  No vendor lock-in, which means that all the configurations for your applications/databases/etc are saved to your server. So, if you decide to stop using Coolify (oh nooo), you could still manage your running resources. You lose the automations and all the magic. ü™ÑÔ∏è
